  <h2>Q&A</h2>
  <p>This section answers common questions about G6PDD.</p>
  <h3>Q: I've been eating all kinds of legumes all my life and am feeling fine. Why do you say I should avoid them?</h3> 
  <p>A: There are more than 400 mutations of the deficiency, each responding differently to certain foods and drugs. 
  Some are more sensitive, others are less so. Besides fava beans, other elements may be harmful to you. Just be aware of this risk.</p>
  <h3>Q: What precautions can I take to ensure my health living with G6PD Deficiency?</h3>
  <p>A: Do not take any of the medications and foods listed on this website (or medications similar to them) without consulting a physician. Also avoid fava beans (and the plant). Always tell any health provider you see that you have G6PD Deficiency (REMEMBER TO CHECK FOR OTHER MEDICATIONS AND OR FOODS BECAUSE WE DO NOT LIST ALL OF THEM!).</p>
  <h3>Q: How can I test the level of my enzyme deficiency?</h3>
  <p>It is a simple blood test. Inquire with your physician.</p>
  <h3>Q: Can I donate blood if I have G6PD Deficiency?</h3>
  <p>A: Most certainly not! Currently the Red Cross does not accept G6PD Deficient Blood.</p>
  <h3>Q: How do I get G6PD Deficiency?</h3>
  <p>G6PD Deficiency is an inherited condition; therefore, you can not get it from being in contact with someone who has G6PD Deficiency. Since it is inherited, there is no cure.</p>
  <h3> Q: What are the chances of passing this condition to my kid?</h3>
  <p>
A) If the father is unaffected (healthy) and the mother is a carrier (no clinical symptoms):
One daughter out of two will be a carrier
One son out of two will be G6PD deficient
B) If the father is G6PD deficient and the mother is unaffected:

All daughters will be carriers
All sons will be unaffected
C) If the father is G6PD deficient and the mother is a carrier:

One daughter out of two will be G6PD deficient
One daughter out of two will be a carrier
One son out of two will be G6PD deficient
One son out of two will be unaffected
D) If the father is unaffected and the mother is G6PD deficient:

All daughters will be carriers
All sons will be G6PD deficient
E) If both father and mother are G6PD deficient:
All daughters will be G6PD deficient
All sons will be G6PD deficient
