  <h2>What is the G6PD Enzyme?</h2>
  <p>The G6PD enzyme helps process carbohydrates and protects red blood cells from damage by reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS are byproducts of normal cellular functions that can become toxic if they build up in red blood cells. 
</p>
  <h2>What causes G6PDD?</h2>
  <p>People with G6PD deficiency do not have enough of the G6PD enzyme.
G6PD deficiency is a lifelong genetic condition that is normally inherited through the female line. It is more common in males, and people with a Mediterranean, African, Asian, South American or Middle Eastern background. 
The breakdown of red blood cells, called 'hemolysis', can lead to anaemia (lack of red blood cells) and jaundice (the yellowing of skin and eyes).
Certain triggers can cause your red blood cells to be destroyed faster than they can be replaced, known as acute hemolytic anaemia (AHA), which can be life-threatening.
